# First-TermPaper
Remake of my first term paper in university
Initially work had been done in C# with Windows forms HOWEVER I LOST SOURCE CODE HEHE So I decided to create a remake in C++ because I LOVE C++

My task by teacher had been next:
1. Store objects in array, vector, list doesn't matter it at least should be in runtime
2. You should have 3 classes and 1 abstract class(interface) and they should be derived by previous class like this IEngine->Engine->ICEngine->JetEngine
3. Create save/open option (i'll do it later)
4. Sort table
5. something else idk
